/// This is where you write some code to
///   1. Access histogram of *data measurement* (ROOT files in data/ directory) of ttbar differential cross section as a function of a) Pt top, b) Mtt
///   2. Access histograms of predctions for these differntial cross sections for different values of Mt 
///   3. Loop over the predictions and calculate the chi^2 between data and each prediciton
///   4. Make a final plot of chi^2 vs. Mt.
///
/// You should study the code in readhisto.cpp to see how to access histograms from ROOT files.
